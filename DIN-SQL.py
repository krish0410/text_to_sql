      Here DATA refers to the table values of all columns of all tables present in the database.You need to refer this DATA for finding 
      and similarities or relevance among values of database and VALUES specified in Question , if yes then use the values from actual
      DATA in question.
      Question refers to the question for which we need to find SQL query.
      Schema_Link contains important tables,columns ,joining conditions and external values that might be useful for generating SQL query for the question.
      Return the generated SQL query which is both syntactically and semantically correct accoring to question.
